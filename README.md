#Docker OpenStack Swift onlyone

This is a docker file that creates an OpenStack swift image which has only one replica and only one device. Why would this be useful? I think that Docker and OpenStack Swift go together like peas and carrots. Distributed files systems are a pain, so why not just use OpenStack Swift? Scaling is not as much of an issue with object storage. Many Docker containers, even on separate hosts, can use one OpenStack Swift container to persist files.

But then why only one replica one and one device? I think that "onlyone" is a good starting point. It will make it easy for developers to get used to using object storage instead of a file system, and when they need the eventual consistency and multiple replicas provided by a larger OpenStack Swift cluster they can work on implementing that. I don't see one replica as an issue in small systems or for a proof-of-concept because it can just be backed up.
